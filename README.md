02/10/2020
Started out downloading python, pycharm, and mysql. Watched some youtube videos on creating an app with Flask.

02/11/2020
Began working on app with Flask. Made very extensive login/signup screen.

02/12/2020
Added more functionality to login/signup screen. Team member decides we are now using Django instead of Flask. Restart project from scratch using Django. More youtube videos for research.

02/13/2020
Team now decides python might not be best choice and have a debate of which language and libraries we should use. Most votes go for React Native. Meet with team, confirm technology stack as node.js and react native. Begin watching videos for useful extensions on Visual Studio Code, test and install them. Begin doing research on making an app with react native.

02/14/2020
Co-worker talks about firebase. Begin researching what it is and how to use it. Decided I will use this for spike exercise.

02/16/2020
Watch videos on creating an app with react and firebase. Follow expo instructions for starting development. Begin setting up firebase as a database for spike exercise. Created home, login, signup, and loading screens based off videos contents.

Conclusion
Though this project felt very overwhelming I was able to get past a lot of the stress and frustration by making my main goal to focus on learning something new. For me that new thing was React Native. Not having any experience in React Native made it very difficult to get started right away. I wanted to approach this Spike Excercise the same way I have past programming projects where I can just jump in and start right away. However, given the size of this project and I really had to slow myself down and take the time to go through tutorials and get a better understanding of how to develop with React Native. I will say that I am happy with the amount I was able to get done. I'm more happy about the fact that I was able to be challenged and was able to come out with a new knowledge in React Native, Firebase, Expo, and Git. I stated it earlier but this Spike Excercise did make me hopeful for our project going forward I think I'll be able to contribute a lot more to my team now then I would have before doing this excercise.
